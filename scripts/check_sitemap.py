"""The list of pages given to Google, walked and compared with the pages that exist.

The lead's instruction for the Google round: «حارس يمشي على القائمة ويقارنها
بالملفات المبنية أفضل من عين» — a guard that walks the list and compares it
with the built files beats an eye.

An eye is exactly what fails here. A sitemap is nine lines that all look alike,
it is read by a machine and never by a person, and nothing on the site goes red
when one of them is wrong: a page left out is simply never indexed, and a page
listed that does not exist is a 404 reported back to the owner in Search
Console weeks later. So the comparison runs **both ways**:

  1. every `<loc>` resolves to a page in the tree that will be uploaded;
  2. every page in that tree appears in the list, exactly once;
  3. every `<loc>` is the address that page itself calls canonical, so the
     sitemap and the page cannot drift apart;
  4. every `<url>` carries a `lastmod` that is a real date and not in the
     future;
  5. the `xhtml:link` alternates inside a `<url>`, where there are any, say the
     same thing as that page's own `<link rel="alternate">` block.

Point 3 is the one that makes this cheap to keep: `check_site.sh` already
derives each page's canonical from its path, so one of the two is always
anchored to the filesystem.
